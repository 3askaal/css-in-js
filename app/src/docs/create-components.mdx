## Create Components

Creating components works the same way as Styled Components, but with a few benefits:
- A wide range of CSS shorthand properties are available.
- Theme values are available by passing keys as strings.
- Responsive styles are available by passing arrays of values, these values are mapped to the breakpoints defined in the theme.

```ts
import { s } from '3oilerplate'

const Button = s.button({
  bg: 'primary',
  color: 'white',
  border: '1px solid',
  borderColor: 'grey[10]',
  p: ['xs', 's', 'm'],
  mb: ['12px', '24px', '36px'],

  '&:hover': {
    bg: 'primaryDark',
  },
})
```

Note: This wrapper currently does not support style strings, only style objects.
